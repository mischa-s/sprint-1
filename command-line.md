Explain Git to Your Mom

The command line is a place that lets you talk to your computer in the language that programs are written in. When you click on icons on your desktop, they are basically just pre-set lines of code, usually very complex and long, but still just lines of code being run by your computer. The command line allows you do this manually. For example you could tell it:

Standard Commands (Git + Normal Terminal)
1. rm   Delete a file
2. pwd  Show a detailed description of where the current file you are working on is located
3. cd   Change which folder you are working in
4. ls   Show any information that is not hidden about the file
5.  diff     Isolate and show any differences between two files

Git Commands
6. git log      Show the history of the file you are working on
7. git commit   Save changes
8. git status   Show the current situation of your work
9. git init     Create a new repository (folder)
10. git branch  Show the current variations of what you are working on
